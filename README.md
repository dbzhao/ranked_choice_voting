# ranked_choice_voting
Implement ranked choice voting evaluation for GD Hack 12.

**Note:** It's pretty brittle so it requires file format to be identical to the one demonstrated in `GD Hack 12 Voting (Responses) - Form Responses 1.csv`. Two columns of "Email Address" and "Timestamp" to identify each ballot, only one header row (no multiindex rows), award and team format of `Award Name [Team Name]`. In the future, I'll work on making this less stringent.
